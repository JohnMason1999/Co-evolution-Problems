# Co-evolution-Problems
A recreation of the problems in this paper: Watson, R. A. and Pollack, J. B. (2001) Coevolutionary Dynamics in a Minimal Substrate. Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2001) pp. 702-709.  http://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu/pr/number_games/gecco2001_cdms.pdf

Mutation bias.py:

short python script that demonstrates the biased mutation drift in the experimental setup, meaning that individuals under no evolutionary pressure tend towards half of maximum fitness.
